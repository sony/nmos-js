# An NMOS Client in JavaScript [![Build Status](https://github.com/sony/nmos-js/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)][build-test]
[build-test]: https://github.com/sony/nmos-js/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild-test

## Introduction

This repository contains a client implementation of the [AMWA Networked Media Open Specifications](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos) in JavaScript, [licensed](LICENSE) under the terms of the Apache License 2.0.

- [AMWA IS-04 NMOS Discovery and Registration Specification](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos-discovery-registration)
- [AMWA IS-05 NMOS Device Connection Management Specification](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos-device-connection-management)
- [AMWA IS-08 NMOS Audio Channel Mapping Specification](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-08/) (read-only for now)
- [AMWA BCP-004-01 NMOS Receiver Capabilities](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-004-01/)

For more information about AMWA, NMOS and the Networked Media Incubator, please refer to http://amwa.tv/.

The [repository structure](Documents/Repository-Structure.md), and the [external dependencies](Documents/Dependencies.md), are outlined in the documentation.

### Getting Started With NMOS

The [Easy-NMOS](https://github.com/rhastie/easy-nmos) starter kit allows the user to launch a simple NMOS setup with minimal installation steps.
It relies on nmos-js to provide an NMOS Client that works with an NMOS Registry and a virtual NMOS Node in a Docker Compose network, along with the AMWA NMOS Testing Tool and supporting services.

### Getting Started For Developers

Easy-NMOS is also a great first way to explore the relationship between NMOS services.

The nmos-js codebase is intended to work with any NMOS Registry, but can take advantage of the features of the [nmos-cpp](https://github.com/sony/nmos-cpp) implementation.

After setting up the dependencies, follow these [instructions](Documents/Getting-Started.md) to build and deploy the nmos-js client itself.

The web application can also be packaged and deployed with the [nmos-cpp-registry application](https://github.com/sony/nmos-cpp).
Copy the contents of the nmos-js build directory into the admin directory next to the nmos-cpp-registry executable.

## Agile Development

[<img alt="JT-NM Tested 03/20 NMOS & TR-1001-1 Controller" src="Documents/images/jt-nm-tested-03-20-controller.png?raw=true" height="135" align="right"/>](https://jt-nm.org/jt-nm_tested/)

The nmos-js client, like the NMOS Specifications, is intended to be always ready, but steadily developing.
The nmos-js client works as both an NMOS Registry browser, using the IS-04 Query API, and provides connection management, using the IS-05 Connection API.
When used with the nmos-cpp-registry, it also provides access to registry log messages.
It has been successfully tested in many AMWA Networked Media Incubator workshops, and in the [JT-NM Tested](https://jt-nm.org/jt-nm_tested/) programme.

### Build Status

The following configurations, defined by the [build-test](.github/workflows/build-test.yml) jobs, are built and unit tested automatically via continuous integration.

| Platform | Version                   | Browser                            | Test Options                                                       |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux    | Ubuntu 22.04 (GCC 11.2.0) | Chrome                             |                                                                    |

The [AMWA NMOS API Testing Tool](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-testing) controller tests are automatically run against the nmos-js user interface using a fully automatated [TestingFaçade](TestingFacade\README.md).
